# GSoC Week 6 - Qt3D based backend for KStars

In the sixth week of GSoC, I worked on adding mouseevents and integrate the custom qt3d window with existing skymap

## What's done this week

- Shaders for panning and zooming.

- camera controller in custom window.


## The Challenges

- Integration issues with the original SkyPainter API written to support multiple backends.

- Use of new custom camera controller and view matrix.

- Zooming and focus for deep star objects.


## What remains

My priorities for the next week include.

- Adding remaining skymap events.

- Writing 3d calls for skymapcomposite.

- Debug deep star objects and get started with other sky objects.


## The Code

 - [Celestial Sphere Prototype](https://github.com/Paritosh97/celestial-sphere-sim)
 - [My fork for KStars](https://invent.kde.org/paritosh/kstars)
